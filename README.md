The sample docker app will be deployed on the ubuntu host from the inventory file at defined port (http://35.177.208.114:3000/).

If you would like to deploy it on your own servers feel free to adjust variables in the inventory file and run the command:

`ansible-playbook -i inventory run.yml`

I'll polish the project a little bit tomorrow.
